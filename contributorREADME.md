# For those wanting to contribute

So you want to contribute to the pack, but may be confused on how to do it? Well we have made this repository specifically so that editing can be done with ease and commits can be done with almost no effort.

Simply clone/fork the repository onto your local machine into an instance which was already made for **1.16.5 Forge** and commit as you see needed. Try to use .gitignore to get rid of any extra files, such as launcher configs, **BEFORE** you pull.

Another thing to note, is that you cannot clone into an already existing folder. To get around this, just clone straight into the instance folder of your launcher and add any necessary files. For example, on GD Launcher, you will need to add the *natives* folder yourself, but this is just a simple `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+v` from a different instance into this one. (GD Launcher files are already ignored on github!)

Make any changes you want, and pull request/push into the branch. It's literally that easy. No need for transfering files. No need for deleting an instance and installing a new one, matter of fact you get the latest install by just pulling latest from github.
